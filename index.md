# About Me
I am a first year PhD student in the Computing and Mathematical Sciences department at the California Institue of Technology, which is located in Pasadena, California. I working with [Katie Bouman](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~klbouman/). Prior to my doctoral studies at Caltech, I was an undergrad at Carnegie Mellon University, where I recieved a B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering with an additional major in Biomedical Engineering with Honors in December of 2018. 

My primary research interests are in computational imaging. I am interested in methods that integrate physics based model with data driven approaches, which can be applied to a broad range of imaging domains from traditional computer vision to medical imaging.
