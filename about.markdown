Welcome to my webpage. My name is Angela Gao and I am a Ph.D student at Caltech in the Computing and Mathematical Sciences Department. 

My research interests are in computational imaging and photography, focusing on the intersection of physics based models with data driven methods. 


Outside of research, I enjoy watercoloring nature and exploring new places.
