# ECE Capstone Design Project: Baby Got Track
#### Carnegie Mellon University
For my senior design project, my team developed a next-generation baby monitoring system with 3 componenets. The smart sock gathers data that is wirelessly transmitted to the raspberry pi via Bluetooth. Biometric information, such as heart rate and sleep cycles, is calculated through signal processing methods. The raspberry pi also has a camera and tracks the eye motion of the baby. We then use a decision tree to predict whether the baby has woken up and sends push notifications through an Android app to parents.

# Biomedical Engineering Senior Project: Medtronic Positional Stabilizer for Image Guidance Trackers Used in Spinal Procedures
#### Carnegie Mellon University
For my BME senior design project, my team worked with Medtronic Inc. to design a stabilizer for image guidance trackers used on surgical instruments. The objective was to allow the tracker to be fixed so that surgeons can operate without holding the tracker fixed. We focused on two different techniques, a counterweight device and a moder based system with a PID controller.
