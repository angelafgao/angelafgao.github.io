# Tutorials

See this [tutorial](https://github.com/helloquat/ehtim-tutorial)(led by [Yvette Lin](https://github.com/helloquat)) for details on how to use the [ehtim](https://achael.github.io/eht-imaging/) package to create your own black hole measurements.


# Caltech Computational Cameras Lab: October 2019 - Present

I currently work in the [Caltech Computational Cameras Lab](https://computationalcameras.org/), and I am advised by [Prof. Katherine Bouman](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~klbouman/). My current project is developing variation methods to solve blind inverse problems. I am working on applying my methods to real world applications, such as seismology.

# AI Powered Inline Cardiac Strain Mapping in Gadgetron on MR Scanners: June 2019 - Aug 2019

I was a summer intern at the [NIH NHLBI](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/) under the supervision of Dr. Peter Kellman and Dr. Hui Xue. My project focused on computing myocardial strain from cardiac MR scans. I used DenseUNets to segment myocardial tissue for strain calculations and developed an algorithm to calculate the myocardial strain from cardiac MR scans in C++.

# Single Shot Illumination Souce Separation: Jan 2018 - May 2019

I worked in the [Image Science Lab](http://imagesci.ece.cmu.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Aswin Sankaranarayan](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~saswin/). My project focused on illumination source separation from a single image using physics-motivated deep neural network architectures. The goal was to learn the components of the image formation model: albedo, reflectivity, and shading.

Dr. Elisa Celis

I used the ADD Health dataset to interpret contagion effects of mental and physical health. I used non-linear models to predict future health markers.

# 3D Reconstruction of Sonorines Using Photometric Stero: June 2017 - Aug 2017

I workd in with [Prof. Adam Finklestein](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~af/) and [Prof. Szymon Rusinkiweicz](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smr/) to develop photometric stereo methods. The goal of my project was to develop a method to reconstruct the 3D shape of sonorines, a delicate plaster record. Here's a section of the 3D reconstruction
