# Caltech Computational Cameras Lab- October 2019 - Present

I currently work on learning improved inverse algorithms by jointly solving for updated forward models and inversion in the context of seismology.

# AI Powered Inline Cardiac Strain Mapping in Gadgetron on MR Scanners- NIH NHLBI
Dr. Peter Kellman, Dr. Hui Xue

I implemented and trained DenseUNets to segment myocardial tissue for strain calculations. i developed an algorithm to calculate the myocardial strain from cardiac MR scans in C++.

# Single Shot Illumination Souce Separation- Carnegie Mellon University
Professor Aswin Sankaranarayanan

I constructed physics motivated deep network architectures to learn the components of the image formation model: albedo, reflectivity, and shading. 

# Social Network Effects on Growth and Development of Adolescents- Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne
Dr. Elisa Celis

I used the ADD Health dataset to interpret contagion effects of mental and physical health. I used non-linear models to predict future health markers. 

# 3D Reconstruction of Sonorines Using Photometric Stero- Princeton University
Professor Adam Finklestein, Professor Szymon Rusinkiewicz

I developed a method to reconstruct the 3D shape of sonorines, a delicate plaster record, using photometric stereo.
